    "We saw in the chapter on _Subroutines_ that it is possible to break a program into re-usable self-contained units. However, when they are included in the same file as the main program they are not truly independent. We could create a subroutine to perform a complex calculation, for example, but it would still have to be compiled alongside a potentially unrelated function to do some plotting. _Modules_ solve this problem by allowing units to be packaged, tested, compiled and distributed separately, allowing the creation of a toolbox of useful functions. For those with experience of other programming language, Fortran modules resemble _Python_ modules but with features of Python and C++ _Classes_. "

    "## Inside a Module\n",
    "\n",
    "A _Module_ can contain variable declarations, which have scope throughout the module, and also units such as subroutines, which can _also_ contain declarations with restricted scope. It cannot contain _bare_ executable statements. The best way to demonstrate what a module looks like is with a simple example:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  ! These values are accessible within the module but not from outside (private).\n",
    "  Integer  :: my_counter = 0\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ! A module can 'contain' multiple units, which can either be public or private.\n",
    "  contains\n",
    "    integer function add_vars(a, b)\n",
    "      Implicit none\n",
    "      \n",
    "      ! Dummy arguments\n",
    "      Integer, intent(in)  :: a\n",
    "      Integer, intent(in)  :: b\n",
    "      \n",

    "end module my_module\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A module always begins with `Module`, and ends with `End module`. Within in we can place declaration statements like `Implicit none` but not program code. This is why the variable `my_counter` has to be declared and initialised in the same step. The first statement, `Private`, is recommended at the beginning of a module as it forces all subsequent contents to have scope restricted to that module unless made explicitly `Public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `contains` statement signifies the point of the module where declarations end and the payload of program units begins. In this case we have a single function that adds two values and returns the result, very similar to the example we saw earlier. We have made it public so that it can be accessed from the main program, otherwise it wouldn't be very useful!\n",

Without defined entry and exit points to subroutines and functions it can be hard to determine where bad values can be set and renders those program units dependent upon external code. They can no longer be self-contained. Modules can be used to replicate the concept of persistent values across program units, but using them as exact duplicates is discouraged as it simply replicates the problems. Rewriting the code to take full advantage of modules will reduce problems of testing and extensibility in future."

    "This example contains exactly the same code as in the above example, with the exception that the function is wrapped in a module, rather than _raw_. Notice that using assumed shape arrays allows us to examine the structure of the array with _intrinsic functions_, so we don't need to pass in the dimensions and size explicitly. The combination of assumed shape arrays and modules means we can create completely self-contained functions that don't need to know about the data structures in the code from which they are called. This is a big step towards creating a toolbox off re-usable functions.\n",

    " * Using the intrinsics such as _lbound_ and _size_, write a nested `do` loop that iterates over the array and prints out the values.\n",
    " * Using your knowledge of array slicing, pass only a section of the `data_store` array into the `process_array` function. Are the results what you expect? Can you see how this would allow you operate only on subsets of your total data or work on multiple sections in parallel?"
