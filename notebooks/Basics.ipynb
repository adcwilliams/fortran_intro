    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran traditionally has used _implicit variable declaration_, whereby the variable name and type don't have to be fixed ahead of use. The _type_ of the variable was determined by the first character of the name and the variable name length was limited to 6 characters. This led to variables such as `ievnct`, representing an _integer_ used to hold an _event counter_. Needless to say, this made Fortran 77 and earlier versions hard to read and debug! Fortunately this has changed in Modern Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "In Modern Fortran, variables should be declared before use, using the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "TYPE(kind)<attributes>   :: varName\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this results in declarations such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "Integer                  :: varName\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional `attributes` list allows the author to specify additional conditions, such as that is is a read-only `parameter`. The optional `kind` parameter specifies the internal representation of the variable, which in practice means precision and range. Both these options will be covered in more depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intrinsic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The five basic (or intrinsic) data types supported by Fortran are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type          | Example       | Description                                 |\n",
    "| ------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| **INTEGER**   | `-25`         | Signed integer                              |\n",
    "| **REAL**      | `7.2e-3`      | Signed floating point                       |\n",
    "| **COMPLEX**   | `(1.0, 2.5)`  | Complex number                              |\n",
    "| **LOGICAL**   | `.true.`      | Boolean `.true.` or `.false.`               |\n",
    "| **CHARACTER** | `'A string'`  | Generally used as an array to form a string |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these types has a default size, or _kind_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: some compilers offer the `DOUBLE PRECISION` type or allow setting the size with the `kind=(x)`, where `x` is the number of bytes requested, but _these are not parts of standard Fortran_ and should be avoided  when writing portable code. Additionally, compilers allow changing the default size of the intrinsic types, so if you want to be sure that your code will run as expected on any architecture it's important to specify the size of every variable you declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifying Intrinsic Type Storage Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently this was a problem. However, recent Fortran standards introduced options. In Fortran 2003 it is possible to use the `selected_real_kind` intrinsic to define variable size:"
