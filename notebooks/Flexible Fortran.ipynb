    "## Derived Types\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen examples of _Intrinsic Types_, the variable types that can be used in Fortran code. We can imagine the situation where we have a very large number of variables decribing the property of an object, any of which are meaningless outside the context of the whole. Take a car, for example. We let if have `colour`, `doors`, `seats`, `age`, and a number of other attributes, but all of these refer to a single object, _the car_. To write any function or subroutine that performs an operation on _the car_, one must pass all its properties separately (and out of context) and return them. Particularly if there a very large number of attributes, this can make code unreadable or potentially even breach Fortran's limit on the permitted number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is an alternative. A _Derived Type_ is a user-defined compound variable consisting of a number of intrinsic types, and can be used to package related variables, giving them context. An example of a very simple derived type follows:\n",

    "```fortran\n",

    "  Type    :: var_name\n",
    "  Type    :: var_name\n",
    "End type <name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is simply a definition. We'd then have to declare an object of this type like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "Type (<name>)  :: my_object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have more than one object of this type, or even an array of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our car, we could define a type as follows:"
