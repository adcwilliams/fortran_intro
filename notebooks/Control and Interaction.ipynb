    "Any programming language must be able to generalise common operations and change functionality depending on certain conditions. Fortran provides a small number of familiar control structures for this purpose, and they generally work by evaluating an _expression_, determining whether the result of that expression is logical _True_ or _False_, and then allowing the control statement to branch according to this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is simply a test of truth, and can be as simple as `x < 10`, meaning _is the value of the variable x less than the number ten_. If it is, the result of the expression is _True_, otherwise _False_. A list of the common _relational operators_ used to construct an expression follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "These operators are similar to those used in other programming languages and replace the older Fortran-77 style operators whereby, for example, _less than_ was represented by `.lt.`. It is possible to test the outcome of expressions simply by printing out the result, as shown in the following example:"
