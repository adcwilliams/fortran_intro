Unlike subroutines where we explicitly _call_ them, thus telling Fortran that the following statement is definitely a subroutine, it is possible that an `add_values` function may a missing intrinsic function or data type, or a program unit that has not been linked correctly. The Fortran compiler can't be sure and thus exits with an error. We have to explicitly tell the compliler than `add_values` is a non-intrinsic function before we can use it.\n",
